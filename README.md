# PROJECT: Œºveez 
## The movie magazine app 

Œºveez is a single-page and multilanguage movie magazine app, built with React & Redux.

it contains two i18n-ized React / Redux SPAs: an admin backend and a front-facing app, with many of the react i18n and l10n bells and whistles that production apps would need.
